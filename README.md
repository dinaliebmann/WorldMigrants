# World Migrants

This project provides visualizations of migrant flows by their source and destination.

[View the code in an interactive jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dinaliebmann/WorldMigrants/master?filepath=notebooks%2Fsankey_diagrams.ipynb) and create a sankey diagram to your own specifications!

Running the code in the notebook will result in the sankey diagram below. This shows all immigrants to Canada in 2017, broken down by their continent and country of origin.
